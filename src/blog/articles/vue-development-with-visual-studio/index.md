Vue.js is a popular open-source JavaScript framework used for building user interfaces and single-page applications. It has a simple and intuitive API that makes it easy to create complex UIs, and it's very flexible and modular, allowing developers to use it in a variety of different ways.

Visual Studio Code is a free, open-source code editor that is widely used by developers around the world. It has a powerful set of features and extensions that make it an excellent choice for developing Vue.js applications.

In this article, we'll take a detailed look at how to use Visual Studio Code to develop Vue.js applications. We'll cover everything from setting up your development environment to creating and debugging Vue.js applications. We'll also provide plenty of code examples and links to external resources to help you get started with Vue.js development in Visual Studio Code.

## Top 5 VSCode plugins for Vue

Here are the top 5 Visual Studio Code plugins for Vue.js development:

1. Vetur - This is the official Vue.js extension for Visual Studio Code. It provides syntax highlighting, code snippets, and autocomplete for Vue.js templates, script and style tags, and Vue.js components. It also includes support for Vue.js features such as Vue Router, Vuex, and Vue-i18n.
2. Vue Peek - This plugin allows you to quickly jump to the definition of a Vue.js component or template by pressing the **`F12`** key. It also supports jumping to the template or script tags of a component from the other tag.
3. Vue.js Extension Pack - This is a collection of Vue-related extensions that include Vetur, Vue Peek, and several other useful extensions for Vue.js development such as ESLint, Prettier, and GitLens.
4. Night Owl - While not specifically a Vue.js extension, Night Owl is a popular theme for Visual Studio Code that is highly recommended for Vue.js development. It provides a dark, high-contrast color scheme that is easy on the eyes and makes it easy to distinguish between different parts of your code.
5. Bracket Pair Colorizer - This plugin colorizes matching brackets in your code, making it easier to see where brackets start and end in nested Vue.js templates, scripts, and styles.

To install these plugins, open the Extensions panel in Visual Studio Code by clicking on the extension's icon on the left sidebar or by pressing **`Ctrl+Shift+X`** (Windows/Linux) or **`Cmd+Shift+X`** (Mac). Search for the plugin by name, then click the "Install" button to install it. Once installed, you may need to reload Visual Studio Code for the plugin to take effect.

By using these plugins in combination with the tips and best practices mentioned in my previous answer, you can streamline your Vue.js development workflow and make it easier to build high-quality Vue.js applications.

## **Setting up your development environment**

Before you can start developing Vue.js applications in Visual Studio Code, you'll need to set up your development environment. Here are the steps you need to follow:

1. Install Node.js: Vue.js is built on top of Node.js, so you'll need to install it first. You can download the latest version of Node.js from the official Node.js website.
2. Install Vue CLI: Vue CLI is a command-line interface for creating and managing Vue.js projects. You can install it by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
npm install -g @vue/cli
```

This will install Vue CLI globally on your system, which means you can use it from any directory on your machine.

3. Create a new Vue.js project: Once you have Vue CLI installed, you can use it to create a new Vue.js project. To do this, run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
   vue create my-project
```

This will create a new Vue.js project in a directory called **`my-project`**. Vue CLI will ask you a series of questions to configure your project, such as which features you want to include and which plugins you want to use.

4. Open your project in Visual Studio Code: Once you have created your project, you can open it in Visual Studio Code by navigating to the project directory and running the following command:

```bash
   code .
```

This will open the project directory in Visual Studio Code, and you can start developing your Vue.js application.

## **Developing Vue.js applications in Visual Studio Code**

Once you have set up your development environment, you can start developing Vue.js applications in Visual Studio Code. Here are some tips and tricks to help you get started:

### **1. Use the Vue.js extension for Visual Studio Code**

Visual Studio Code has a great extension system, which means you can add additional functionality to the editor through extensions. The Vue.js extension for Visual Studio Code is a must-have for Vue.js developers, as it provides syntax highlighting, code snippets, and other useful features for developing Vue.js applications.

You can install the Vue.js extension for Visual Studio Code by going to the Extensions panel (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X) and searching for "Vue.js". Once you have installed the extension, you can start using its features.

### **2. Use the Vue.js template language**

Vue.js has its own template language, which allows you to define your UI components in a very declarative and intuitive way. The Vue.js template language is based on HTML, but it has some additional syntax for defining bindings, directives, and other Vue-specific features.

When you're working with Vue.js templates in Visual Studio Code, you can take advantage of the Vue.js extension's syntax highlighting and IntelliSense features. These features will help you write Vue.js templates more quickly and with fewer errors, as they provide suggestions and auto-completion for Vue-specific syntax.

### **3. Use the Vue.js devtools**

The Vue.js devtools are a browser extension that allows you to inspect and debug Vue.js applications. They provide a lot of useful information about your Vue.js components, such as their props, data, computed properties, and events.

To use the Vue.js devtools with your Vue.js application in Visual Studio Code, you need to install the browser extension first. You can find links to the Chrome and Firefox versions of the Vue.js devtools on the official Vue.js website.

Once you have installed the Vue.js devtools, you can open them by clicking on the Vue.js icon in the browser's toolbar. You can then use the devtools to inspect your Vue.js components and debug your application.

## **Conclusion**

In this article, we've covered how to use Visual Studio Code to develop Vue.js applications. We've looked at how to set up your development environment, how to use the Vue.js extension for code highlighting, how to use the Vue.js devtools, how to use the Vue.js component system, and how to use the Vue.js router.

By following these tips and best practices, you can streamline your Vue.js development workflow and make it easier to build high-quality Vue.js applications. Remember to keep learning and experimenting with new tools and techniques, as the Vue.js ecosystem is constantly evolving and improving.

Vite and Vue CLI are both build tools and development environments for Vue.js applications. While they serve similar purposes, there are some differences between the two.

## Whatâ€™s VITE

Vite (pronounced "veet") is a relatively new build tool developed by the creators of Vue.js. It focuses on providing a faster development experience by leveraging native ES module imports and bundling modules on the fly during development.

Vite uses a highly optimized development server that enables quick hot module replacement (HMR) and fast reloading. It achieves this by leveraging modern JavaScript features and the browser's native module system.

Vite also supports various front-end frameworks, including Vue.js, React, and Preact. It provides an out-of-the-box development setup with zero configuration for Vue projects, making it very easy to get started. Vite is optimized for single-page applications (SPAs) and offers excellent performance during development.

## What's Vue CLI

Vue CLI (Command-Line Interface) is a more established and feature-rich tool for building Vue.js applications. It offers a complete development environment that includes project scaffolding, a build system, a development server, and other features.

Vue CLI simplifies the setup process by providing a command-line interface to create, configure, and manage Vue projects.

With Vue CLI, you can easily generate a project structure, manage dependencies, and run tasks such as building for production or running tests. It uses Webpack as the default bundler and offers various configuration options to customize your project.

Vue CLI also provides a plugin system, allowing you to extend its functionality with additional features and integrations.

## When to use Vite or Vue CLI

Here are some considerations for choosing between Vite and Vue CLI:

### Development Speed

If you prioritize faster development and quicker feedback loops, Vite is a great choice. It provides a rapid development experience with instant module hot-reloading and optimized bundling for faster builds during development.

### Project Complexity

For more complex projects that require extensive configuration, customizations, or integration with other tools, Vue CLI offers a broader range of options and features. It provides a full-fledged development environment with powerful build and customization capabilities.

### Tooling Ecosystem

Vue CLI has been around longer and has a more mature ecosystem. It has a vast collection of plugins, presets, and community support, making it a good choice for projects that require specific tools or integrations.

In summary, if you value faster development and want a quick setup for your Vue.js project, Vite is an excellent choice. On the other hand, if you have more complex requirements, need extensive customization options, or want to leverage the mature Vue CLI ecosystem, it would be a better fit.

Ultimately, the choice between Vite and Vue CLI depends on the specific needs and goals of your project.

## What do I recommend?

I would recommend Vite and here is why:

Vite, which was released recently, has garnered significant attention and diverse usage for building JavaScript applications across various frameworks.

In my personal experience, I encountered challenges with Webpack, particularly in larger projects where it took a considerable amount of time for building and compiling JavaScript.

This aspect is one of the reasons why I lean towards choosing Vite, considering that Vue CLI relies on Webpack for compilation.

Here are a few reasons why I would recommend Vite:

### Swift Development

Vite is designed to offer a rapid development experience. Its utilization of native ES module imports and on-the-fly bundling facilitates quick hot module replacement (HMR) and fast reloading. This aspect greatly enhances development speed and overall productivity.

### Instant Feedback

With Vite, changes made in the codebase are swiftly reflected in the application. The lightweight development server allows for immediate updates, enabling developers to observe the results of their code changes without the need for a complete rebuild.

### Simplified Configuration

Vite strives to minimize configuration complexity. It provides a zero-configuration setup for Vue projects, allowing developers to commence coding without spending excessive time on the initial configuration. The default settings and conventions are well-suited for most projects, thereby reducing setup time.

### Seamless Vue Integration

Vite is developed by the creators of Vue.js and seamlessly integrates with Vue projects. It has built-in support for Vue Single File Components (SFC), which simplifies working within the Vue ecosystem and leveraging Vue's features and tooling.

### Enhanced Performance

Vite's development server and optimized bundling contribute to excellent performance during development. The utilization of native ES modules and on-demand bundling results in faster builds, quicker reloading, and a more responsive development experience overall.

It is worth noting that while Vite excels in terms of development speed and developer experience, Vue CLI may be a more suitable choice for complex projects that require extensive customization, configuration, or integration with other tools. It is advisable to evaluate both tools based on project requirements and personal preferences to determine the best fit.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Vite has gained significant interest and diverse usage since its release, particularly for building JavaScript applications across different frameworks. Many developers, including myself, have faced challenges with Webpack, especially in larger projects where it can be time-consuming to build and compile JavaScript.

This has led to a preference for Vite, as it provides a faster development experience and resolves some of the pain points associated with Webpack.

Vite offers swift development with instant feedback, thanks to its utilization of native ES module imports and on-the-fly bundling. It simplifies configuration with its zero-configuration setup for Vue projects and seamlessly integrates with the Vue ecosystem.

Additionally, Vite's performance is enhanced through its optimized bundling and responsive development server. While Vite excels in terms of development speed and developer experience, it's important to consider the specific requirements of your project.

For complex projects requiring extensive customization, configuration, or integration with other tools, Vue CLI with Webpack may still be a suitable choice due to its broader feature set and mature ecosystem.

Ultimately, the choice between Vite and Vue CLI should be based on your project's needs, preferences, and trade-offs you are willing to make in terms of development speed and flexibility. Evaluating both tools and considering their strengths will help you determine the best fit for your specific circumstances.

"Is Vue easier than JavaScript?" is a common question among web developers, especially those who are new to front-end development. While Vue.js is a JavaScript framework that provides developers with a set of tools and features to build web applications, it's important to understand that Vue.js is built on top of JavaScript and requires a strong understanding of JavaScript in order to use it effectively.

## **Vue.js vs. JavaScript**

Vue.js provides developers with several features that can make building web applications easier and more efficient. For example, Vue.js uses a template-based syntax that allows developers to easily create dynamic and reactive user interfaces without having to write a lot of complex code. Vue.js also provides a lot of built-in functionality for common tasks like handling user input, managing component state, and making HTTP requests.

However, it's important to note that learning Vue.js still requires a solid understanding of JavaScript fundamentals. Vue.js is a JavaScript framework, which means that it is built on top of the JavaScript language and requires a strong understanding of JavaScript in order to use it effectively.

According to **[Vue.js's official documentation](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/comparison.html#Vue-js-vs-jQuery)**, Vue.js can be easier to learn than traditional JavaScript frameworks like jQuery or Angular. This is because Vue.js has a simpler and more intuitive API, and is generally more lightweight and flexible. However, learning Vue.js still requires a solid understanding of JavaScript.

## **What should a Vue Developer learn in JavaScript?**

If you're interested in learning Vue.js, it's important to have a good understanding of JavaScript fundamentals first. Some of the key concepts and skills that you should be familiar with include:

- Variables and data types
- Control structures (if/else statements, for loops, while loops, etc.)
- Functions and scope
- Object-oriented programming concepts (classes, inheritance, etc.)
- Asynchronous programming with promises and callbacks

Once you have a good grasp of these fundamentals, you'll be better equipped to understand the core concepts of Vue.js and how to use its features effectively.

## **Conclusion**

In conclusion, while Vue.js provides developers with a set of tools and features that can make building web applications easier and more efficient, it's important to understand that Vue.js is built on top of JavaScript and requires a strong understanding of JavaScript fundamentals in order to use it effectively. If you're interested in learning Vue.js, make sure to take the time to build a solid foundation in JavaScript first. With a good understanding of JavaScript, you'll be well-equipped to take advantage of all that Vue.js has to offer.

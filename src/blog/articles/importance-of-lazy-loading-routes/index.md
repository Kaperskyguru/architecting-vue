When building modern web applications, it's essential to consider the performance and user experience of your application. One area where this is particularly important is in the routing of your application.

Vue 3 provides an excellent routing system in the form of the Vue Router, which allows developers to easily create complex routing scenarios. One powerful feature of the Vue Router is lazy loading routes, which can significantly improve the performance and user experience of your application.

In this article, we'll explore what lazy loading routes are and why they are essential in Vue 3. We'll also provide examples of how to use lazy loading routes in Vue 3 to improve your application's performance.

## **What are Lazy Loading Routes?**

Lazy loading routes in Vue 3 refer to the practice of loading only the code that is required for a specific route when it is needed.

This means that instead of loading all the code for your application upfront, which can result in a slower initial load time, you only load the code that is required for a specific route when the user navigates to that route.

By using lazy loading routes, you can reduce the initial loading time of your application and improve its overall performance. This is especially important when you have a large application with many routes, components, and libraries.

## **Why are Lazy Loading Routes Important?**

Lazy loading routes are important in Vue 3 for several reasons, including:

### **1. Faster Initial Loading Time**

One of the most significant benefits of lazy loading routes is that they can significantly reduce the initial loading time of your application. Instead of loading all the code for your application upfront, which can take a long time for large applications, you only load the code that is required for a specific route when the user navigates to that route. This means that your application can start faster and provide a better user experience.

### **2. Smaller Bundle Size**

Lazy loading routes can also reduce the size of your application's JavaScript bundle. This is because you only load the code that is required for a specific route when the user navigates to that route. This can be particularly important for mobile devices, which may have limited bandwidth or slower internet connections.

### **3. Improved Caching**

Lazy loading routes can also improve caching in your application. When you only load the code that is required for a specific route when the user navigates to that route, the browser can cache that code, which can improve the performance of your application for subsequent visits.

### **4. Better User Experience**

Lazy loading routes can provide a better user experience by reducing the time it takes for your application to load and by making your application feel faster and more responsive.

## **How to Use Lazy Loading Routes in Vue 3**

Now that we understand what lazy loading routes are and why they are essential in Vue 3, let's take a look at how to use lazy loading routes in Vue 3.

To use lazy loading routes in Vue 3, we need to use dynamic imports to load the code for a specific route when it is needed.

Let's take a look at an example:

```jsx
const routes = [
  {
    path: "/",
    name: "Home",
    component: () => import("./views/Home.vue"),
  },
  {
    path: "/about",
    name: "About",
    component: () => import("./views/About.vue"),
  },
  {
    path: "/contact",
    name: "Contact",
    component: () => import("./views/Contact.vue"),
  },
];
```

In this example, we have defined three routes, and we are using dynamic imports to load the code for each route when it is needed.

When the user navigates to the `Home` route, for example, only the code for the `Home` component is loaded, and not the code for the `About` or `Contact` components. This can significantly reduce the initial loading time of your application and improve its performance.

You can also use lazy loading routes with nested routes in Vue 3. Let's take a look at an example:

```json
const routes = [
  {
    path: '/',
    name: 'Home',
    component: () => import('./views/Home.vue')
  },
  {
    path: '/products',
    name: 'Products',
    component: () => import('./views/Products.vue'),
    children: [
      {
        path: 'shirts',
        name: 'Shirts',
        component: () => import('./views/Shirts.vue')
      },
      {
        path: 'pants',
        name: 'Pants',
        component: () => import('./views/Pants.vue')
      }
    ]
  }
]

```

In this example, we have defined a `Product` route that has two child routes, `Shirts` and `Pants`.

We are using dynamic imports to load the code for each route when it is needed. When the user navigates to the `Products` route, only the code for the Products component is loaded, and not the code for the child components.

When the user navigates to the `Shirts` or `Pants` routes, only the code for the respective component is loaded, and not the code for the other components. This can significantly improve the performance of your application.

## **Conclusion**

Lazy loading routes are a powerful feature of the Vue Router in Vue 3 that can significantly improve the performance and user experience of your application.

By only loading the code that is required for a specific route when it is needed, you can reduce the initial loading time of your application, reduce the size of your application's JavaScript bundle, improve caching, and provide a better user experience.

In this article, we explored what lazy loading routes are and why they are essential in Vue 3. We also provided examples of how to use lazy loading routes in Vue 3 to improve your application's performance.

By implementing lazy loading routes in your Vue 3 application, you can ensure that your application provides an excellent user experience and performs well for your users.

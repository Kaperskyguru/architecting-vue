The book is well-structured, and the author does an excellent job of explaining complex concepts in a clear and concise manner. What sets this book apart is its focus on enterprise-level applications. The author (Solomon) provides practical guidance on how to architect and build applications that are scalable, high-performance, and maintainable. I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking to take their Vue3 skills to the next level. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, you'll find value in this book. It's a must-have resource for anyone looking to build enterprise-ready applications with Vue3 and JavaScript.`,

Having purchased many templates over the years, some were basic some were really advanced, bending those to what I needed was a pain, this is a great book for Vue.js in general. If I had read this book before building cloud front ends for over three years It would have saved me some serious frustrations. A good reference book to have around, glad I had the chance to review it.",

    The author covers almost everything you would want to know about Vue. There are chapters about testing, deploying, and even dockerizing your Vue app!
    
    The book is easy to follow and provides excellent explanations for all the fundamental concepts. Most importantly that it covers the latest Vue version (Vue 3) and all the latest updates! Of course, each chapter goes with nice examples of code.
    
    Overall impressions are very good. This is so far the best book about Vue that I've read so far. I can definitely recommend it to everybody who is willing to learn Vue`,

It is a great starting point for beginners and can definitely teach intermediate developers a lot about the framework, such as Automated Testing for the framework, deployment of a Vue application, and generally important information about state management, routing and working with APIs in the framework. It isn't too technical, which makes the reading easy to follow and understand, and by the end you will definitely have learned how to develop the major parts of a large-scale frontend application. I would recommend the book as solid material for Vue 3 and suggest that if you decide to get this book, follow along through the example applications on your own laptop or computer so that the material is better understood!",
